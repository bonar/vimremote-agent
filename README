VimRemote-Agent

DESCRIPTION

   VimRemote::Agent is a simple client for vim server operations.

   This module is just a system call wrappers for vim server mode operations.
   All the functions use IPC::Run to call vim commands and get its output,
   so it is very slow.

   XS version is comming up in 2050.

ABOUT VIM SERVER

   Vim can act as a command server. this command will start new server
   named "BONAR".

     vim --servername=BONAR

   Now you can send file operation command or other vimscript to the
   server "BONAR".

     vim --servername=BONAR --remote "foo.txt"
     vim --servername=BONAR --remote-send 'echo "Happy vimming"';

   See vim help for details:
     :help remote

   Vim server mode (--remote) is not in default configure flag. your vim
   has to be compiled with this configure flag to use it.

     ./configure +clientserver

   Check compile options with :version command in vim normal mode.
